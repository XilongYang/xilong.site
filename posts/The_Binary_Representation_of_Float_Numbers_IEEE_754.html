            <h2 id="issue">Issue</h2>
            <p>Code for the issue:</p>
            <pre class="language-c line-numbers match-braces"><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 

int main() {
  int arr[10] = {3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3};

  // Calculate the mean of all the numbers in arr.
  float a = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; ++i) {
    a += (float)arr[i] / 10;   
  }
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; ++i) {
    if (arr[i] &gt; a) {
        printf(&quot;%d &quot;, arr[i]);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}</code></pre>
            <p>It’s evident that the above program theoretically
            shouldn’t output any data. However, the actual execution
            result is as follows:</p>
            <pre><code>3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 </code></pre>
            <h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
            <p>After several attempts, I finally found that the issue is
            caused by the value of ‘a’ in this program not being 3.0,
            but rather 2.9999. This suggests that the problem is
            probably linked to the precision of the floating-point
            arithmetic.</p>
            <p>Here is a introduction to the <em>IEEE 754</em>
            floating-point number standard, which is followed by the C
            programming language.</p>
            <p>A floating-point number which according to the IEEE 754
            standard has a form comprising a single <strong>sign
            bit</strong>, followed by <em>k</em> bits for the
            <strong>exponent</strong>, and <em>n</em> bits for the
            <strong>fraction</strong>.</p>
            <p>For example, when <em>k</em> = 8 and <em>n</em> = 23, the
            form is shown in the diagram below,</p>
            <table>
            <thead>
            <tr class="header">
            <th>Sign</th>
            <th>Exponent</th>
            <th>Fraction</th>
            </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
            <tr class="odd">
            <td>x</td>
            <td>xxxx xxxx</td>
            <td>xxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx</td>
            </tr>
            </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>The <strong>sign bit</strong> determines whether the
            number is positive or negative. It will be set to ‘0’ when
            the number is positive. Otherwise it will be set to ‘1’.</p>
            <p>The <em>k</em> bits in <strong>exponent</strong> area
            determine one of three categories for a floating-point
            number and represents its exponent. Furthermore, the value
            of <em>k</em> also determines a <strong>Bias</strong> value
            calculated as <span
            class="math inline">\(2^{k-1}-1\)</span>.</p>
            <p>The <em>n</em> bits in <strong>fraction</strong> area
            determine a value of the number without exponent. Just like
            the coefficient of a number expressed in scientific
            notation.</p>
            <p>Thus, the value of a floating-point number can be
            calculated by the expression:</p>
            <p><span class="math display">\[
            V = (-1)^S \times M \times 2^E
            \]</span></p>
            <p>Where S is the value of the <strong>sign bit</strong>, M
            is the value represented by the <strong>fraction</strong>
            and E is the value represented by the
            <strong>exponent</strong>.</p>
            <h3 id="normalized-values">Normalized Values</h3>
            <p>When the k bits in the exponent area are neither all 0s
            nor all 1s, the number is a <strong>normalized</strong>
            value. For a normalized value, the exponent of the number is
            calculated by the following expression.</p>
            <p><span class="math display">\[
            E = e - Bias.
            \]</span></p>
            <p>Where e is the unsigned number value of exponent
            area.</p>
            <p>In this form, the fraction area has a implicit leadding 1
            in the left of the point. That is:</p>
            <p><span class="math display">\[
            M = 1.fraction
            \]</span></p>
            <p>For example, a float-point number with <em>k</em> = 3
            bits for exponent and <em>n</em> = 4 bits for fraction,
            which has a bit-level representation
            <code>0 001 1010</code>. It will yield a value:</p>
            <p><span class="math display">\[
            S = 0
            \]</span> <span class="math display">\[
            Bias = 2^{k-1} - 1 = 3
            \]</span> <span class="math display">\[
            E = 1 - Bias = -2
            \]</span> <span class="math display">\[
            M = 1.1010
            \]</span> <span class="math display">\[
            V = -1^0 \times 1.1010 \times 2^{-2} = 0.011010
            \]</span></p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>Why don’t we use the exponent value directly rather than
            minus a suspicious Bias?</p>
            <p>The reason is to represent the negative exponent
            naturally. We can easily compare two exponent just by
            compare its unsigned value of the bit-level
            representation.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <h3 id="denormalized-values">Denormalized Values</h3>
            <p>When the bits in the exponent area are all 0s, the number
            is a <strong>denormalized</strong> value. There are only 2
            difference between a normalized value and a denormalized
            value.</p>
            <ol type="1">
            <li>The exponent of the number is calculated by the
            following expression.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><span class="math display">\[
            E = 1 - Bias
            \]</span></p>
            <ol start="2" type="1">
            <li>The fraction has no more implicit 1 in the head. That
            is:</li>

            <p>For example, a float-point number with <em>k</em> = 3
            bits for exponent and <em>n</em> = 4 bits for fraction,
            which has a bit-level representation <code>0 00 1010</code>
            will yield a value:</p>

            <blockquote>
            <p>Why don’t we use the <span
            class="math inline">\(-Bias\)</span> to be the value of the
            exponent, rather than <span
            class="math inline">\(1-Bias\)</span>?</p>
            <p>The reason is to take a naturally transform from
            denormalized values to normalized values.</p>
            <p>For example, consider a number which has <em>k</em> = 3
            bit to represent the exponent and <em>n</em> = 4 bit for the
            fraction. The biggest <strong>denormalized</strong> values
            in the form has a bit-level represention:</p>
            <p>0 000 1111, the values is: <span
            class="math inline">\(0.1111 \times
            2^{1-(2^{3-1}-1)}\)</span> = <span
            class="math inline">\(0.001111\)</span></p>
            <p>Increase it by 1 in the bit-level, we can get the
            smallest <strong>normalized</strong> number which has a
            bit-level represention:</p>
            <p>0 001 0000, the values is: <span
            class="math inline">\(1.0000 \times
            2^{1-(2^{3-1}-1)}\)</span> = <span
            class="math inline">\(0.010000\)</span></p>
            <p>If the exponent set to <span
            class="math inline">\(-Bias\)</span> directly, the value of
            the denormalized number will be:</p>
            <p><span class="math inline">\(0.1111 \times 2^{-(2^{3-1} -
            1)} = 0.0001111\)</span></p>
            <p>We can look the <span
            class="math inline">\(1-Bias\)</span> as <span
            class="math inline">\(-Bias + 1\)</span>, it is a
            compensation for the lack of the leading 1 in a denormalized
            value.</p>

            <h3 id="special-values">Special Values</h3>
            <p>When the bits in the exponent area are set to all 1s,
            there are 2 special form depending on whether the bits in

            <p>Limited by the memory space, there are 2 factors that can
            lead a lack of precision.</p>
            <ol type="1">
            <li><p>The number is so large that the exponent can not be
            represent. For example, the number <span
            class="math inline">\(2^{5000}\)</span> can not be
            represented even by the type <code>double</code>, because a
            <code>double</code> can only represents a exponent between
            <span class="math inline">\(1 - 2^{11 - 1} + 1 =

            2^{11 - 1} + 1 =1023\)</span>.</p></li>
            <li><p>The number has too many digit so that the fraction
            bits is not enough to represent it. For example, the number
            <span
            class="math inline">\(0.1100110011001100110011000101_2\)</span>
            needs 27 bit to represent its fraction (the leading 1 can be
            left out), but a <code>float</code> only has 23 bits to
            represent the fraction.</p></li>
            </ol>
            <blockquote>
            <p>Note</p>
            <p>The effection of the exponent is to move the point to
            difference posiiton of a floating-point number (that’s why
            it is called “floating-point”), that makes it possible to
            get a very large value. But since we can only set the value
            for a limited fraction, the precision of the possible value
            is also limited.</p>
            <p>For example, when <em>k</em> = 8 and <em>n</em> = 3 we
            can simply represent <span
            class="math inline">\(2^{100}\)</span> by the
            represention:</p>
            <p>0 11100011 000</p>
            <p>But we can’t represent <span
            class="math inline">\(1.1111_2 \times 2^{100}\)</span> since
            we can only control the first 3 bits actually in the hundred
            of 0s.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>When we face to the precision problem, the only way we
            can choose is make it rounding. The default rule of rounding
            is called “Round-to-even”.</p>
            <p>To explain the rule, consider a number which has a form
            like <span class="math inline">\(...xxx.xxyyyy...\)</span>.
            The position we want to round is between the least x and the
            most y. A value is on halfway between two possibilities only
            if it has a form like <span
            class="math inline">\(xxx.xx1000...\)</span>, that is the
            most y is 1 and followed by all 0s.</p>
            <ol type="1">
            <li><p>If the value is not on the halfway between two
            possibilities, round to the nearer one. For example, if we
            want to save 2 digit after the point, the number 1.01101
            will round to 1.10 and the number 1.01001 will round to
            1.01.</p></li>
            <li><p>If the value is on the halfway between two
            possibilities, we tend to make the least digit before the
            position we want to round to 0. For example, if we want to
            save 2 digit after the point, the number 1.01100 will round
            to 1.10 and the number 1.10100 will round to 1.10.</p></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Because the last digit of a rounded number is always 0
            (so that the number is even), the rule is called
            “round-to-even”.</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>Why it choose round-to-even instead round-to-zero?</p>
            <p>Because a half of numbers is even, a number will round
            upward about 50% of the time and round downward about 50% of
            the time. It can balance the loss which caused by
            rounding.</p>

            <p>Let’s back to the issue, get the IEEE 754 representation
            of <span class="math inline">\(0.3_{10}\)</span>.</p>
            <p>Transfer <span class="math inline">\(0.3_{10}\)</span> to
            normalized binary representation:</p>
            <p><span class="math display">\[
            1.00110011001100110011001... \times 10_2^{-10}
            \]</span></p>
            <p>We can notice that the binary representation of <span
            class="math inline">\(0.3_{10}\)</span> is a unfiniate
            number. So it will be rounding when transfer to IEEE 754
            representation. Since it is bigger than halfway, it will
            round upward:</p>
            <table>
            <thead>
            <tr class="header">
            <th>Sign</th>
            <th>EXP</th>
            <th>Fraction</th>
            </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
            <tr class="odd">
            <td>0</td>
            <td>01111101</td>
            <td>001 1001 1001 1001 1001 1010</td>
            </tr>
            </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>Translate the binary representation to hex, it should be
            <span class="math inline">\(3e99999a_{16}\)</span>. We can
            validate it by the following program:</p>
            <pre class="language-c line-numbers match-braces"><code>#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main()
{
    float a = 0.3;
    printf(&quot;%x&quot;, *(int *)&amp;a);
    return 0;
}</code></pre>
            <p>output:</p>
            <pre><code>3e99999a</code></pre>
            <p>The result is met our expectations.</p>
